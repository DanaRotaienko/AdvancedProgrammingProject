# AdvancedProgrammingProject

The EUAS Advanced Programming course work emulates a game between computer 
and the User in a battle of the ships.

Start Main.py

The game is implemented by Dana and Eduard as follows:
  - Dana: ComputerStrategy, EnemyShips
  - Eduard: Turns and DeckPlace

Together: DeckLabel, View and Main, where Dana's focus was slightly more 
on design and Eduard's slightly more on logic, although both input are valuable
